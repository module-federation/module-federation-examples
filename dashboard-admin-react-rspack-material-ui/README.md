## Introduction

This system seamlessly integrates modular components, allowing for efficient code splitting and loading only the necessary resources on-demand. The Material UI design system ensures a sleek and responsive user interface, while the Webpack 5 and Rspack (using Module Federation) enhances scalability by enabling the sharing of modules across different micro-apps. With real-time data updates and a user-friendly interface, this dashboard provides an intuitive and visually appealing experience for users navigating complex datasets.
