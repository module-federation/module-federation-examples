# Version Discrepency Example

This example demos two federated apps that use two different versions of lodash.

- `app1` uses lodash@4.10.0.
- `app2` uses lodash@4.11.0 and `lodash.nth`--a feature not available in lodash@4.10.0.

# Running Demo
Run `yarn`
Run `yarn start`. 
This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)

# Running Cypress E2E Tests

To run tests in interactive mode, run  `npm run cypress:debug` from the root directory of the project. It will open Cypress Test Runner and allow to run tests in interactive mode. [More info about "How to run tests"](../../cypress/README.md#how-to-run-tests)

To build app and run test in headless mode, run `yarn e2e:ci`. It will build app and run tests for this workspace in headless mode. If tets failed cypress will create `cypress` directory in sample root folder with screenshots and videos.
