# Dynamic Remote Vendor Sharing Example

This example demonstrates advanced Module Federation capabilities for **dynamic remote loading** and **vendor code sharing** between unknown remotes at runtime. It showcases how a host application can load remote components on-demand without compile-time knowledge of their locations, while efficiently sharing dependencies.

> **⚠️ Important Note**: True dynamic remotes (where you don't know what you're importing at build time) are **very rare** in practice. For most use cases where you need dynamic remote URLs but know the component interfaces, consider using **runtime plugins** instead:
> 
> - **[Remote Control Example](../../runtime-plugins/remote-control)** - Dynamic remote URL configuration with runtime plugins
> - **[Remote Router Example](../../runtime-plugins/remote-router)** - Dynamic routing with runtime remote management
> 
> These approaches provide better type safety, performance, and maintainability while still allowing runtime URL configuration.

## Project Overview

This example illustrates the power of Module Federation's runtime API for creating truly dynamic micro-frontend architectures. The host application (`app1`) can dynamically load and render components from remote applications (`app2` and `app3`) at runtime, demonstrating vendor sharing optimization where dependencies like React and Moment.js are shared efficiently between applications.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Runtime remote registration and loading
- Dynamic component rendering with error handling
- Vendor dependency sharing optimization
- Cross-application state and dependency management

## Architecture

### Applications Structure

- **`app1`** - Host Application (Port 3001)
  - Serves as the container application
  - Dynamically loads remotes using `@module-federation/runtime`
  - Manages shared dependencies (React, ReactDOM)
  - Provides UI for remote component selection

- **`app2`** - Remote Application (Port 3002)
  - Exposes a `Widget` component
  - Uses Moment.js for date formatting
  - Demonstrates vendor sharing with external dependencies

- **`app3`** - Remote Application (Port 3003)  
  - Exposes a `Widget` component with React hooks
  - Uses Moment.js and Redux for state management
  - Shows advanced dependency sharing scenarios

### Dynamic Loading Flow

```
1. Host app initializes Module Federation runtime
2. Runtime registers remote entry points
3. User triggers component load via UI
4. Host dynamically imports remote component
5. Shared dependencies are resolved efficiently
6. Component renders with fallback handling
```

## Current Implementation

### Host Application Dynamic Loading

The host uses the Module Federation runtime API to initialize and load remotes:

```javascript
// Runtime initialization with remote registration
init({
  name: 'app1',
  remotes: [
    { name: 'app2', entry: 'http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js' },
    { name: 'app3', entry: 'http://localhost:3003/remoteEntry.js' }
  ]
});

// Dynamic component loading hook
function useDynamicImport({ module, scope }) {
  const [component, setComponent] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const loadComponent = async () => {
      try {
        const { default: Component } = await loadRemote(`${scope}/${module}`);
        setComponent(() => Component);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error loading remote module ${scope}/${module}:`, error);
      }
    };
    
    loadComponent();
  }, [module, scope]);
  
  return component;
}
```

### Vendor Sharing Configuration

Each application configures shared dependencies to optimize bundle sizes:

```javascript
// Host configuration (app1)
shared: {
  react: {
    singleton: true,
    shareScope: 'default'
  },
  'react-dom': {
    singleton: true
  }
}

// Remote configuration (app2/app3)
shared: {
  react: {
    requiredVersion: deps.react,
    singleton: true
  },
  'react-dom': {
    requiredVersion: deps['react-dom'],
    singleton: true
  },
  moment: deps.moment // Shared between remotes
}
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and pnpm
- Modern browser with ES2020 support
- Network access for cross-origin requests

### Installation & Running

1. **Install dependencies for all applications:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Start all applications simultaneously:**
   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```
   This starts:
   - Host app on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
   - Remote app2 on [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)  
   - Remote app3 on [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003)

3. **Alternative: Legacy Webpack mode:**
   ```bash
   pnpm legacy:start
   ```

4. **Production build:**
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm serve
   ```

### Usage Instructions

1. Open the host application at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
2. Click "Load App 2 Widget" to dynamically load the red widget from app2
3. Click "Load App 3 Widget" to dynamically load the purple widget from app3
4. Observe shared dependency optimization in browser DevTools Network tab
5. Check browser console for loading logs and shared module information

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Runtime Remote Registration
- Remotes are registered at runtime, not build time
- Entry points can be discovered dynamically
- No compile-time coupling between host and remotes

### 2. Dynamic Import with Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when remotes are unavailable
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Component lazy loading with Suspense

### 3. Vendor Code Sharing
- React/ReactDOM shared as singletons across applications
- Moment.js shared between app2 and app3
- Automatic version resolution and deduplication

### 4. Cross-Application Dependency Management
- Shared scope management for dependency isolation
- Version compatibility handling
- Singleton enforcement for framework libraries

## Configuration Explained

### Module Federation Plugin Configuration

**Host Configuration:**
```javascript
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'app1',
  shared: {
    react: { singleton: true },
    'react-dom': { singleton: true }
  }
})
```

**Remote Configuration:**
```javascript
new ModuleFederationPlugin({
  name: 'app2',
  filename: 'remoteEntry.js',
  exposes: {
    './Widget': './src/Widget'
  },
  shared: {
    react: { requiredVersion: deps.react, singleton: true },
    'react-dom': { requiredVersion: deps['react-dom'], singleton: true },
    moment: deps.moment
  }
})
```

### Rspack vs Webpack Support

The example supports both Rspack (default) and Webpack bundlers:
- **Rspack**: Faster builds with `rspack serve`
- **Webpack**: Legacy support with `webpack-cli serve`
- Both configurations maintain feature parity

## Known Issues & Limitations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**1. CORS Errors During Development**
```javascript
// Add to webpack.config.js devServer
headers: {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'
}
```

**2. Shared Dependency Version Conflicts**
```javascript
// Use strict version matching
shared: {
  react: {
    requiredVersion: '^18.0.0',
    singleton: true,
    strictVersion: true
  }
}
```

**3. Remote Loading Failures**
```javascript
// Implement retry logic
const loadWithRetry = async (remoteName, retries = 3) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
    try {
      return await loadRemote(remoteName);
    } catch (error) {
      if (i === retries - 1) throw error;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000 * (i + 1)));
    }
  }
};
```

**4. Development Server Port Conflicts**
```bash
# Check and gracefully terminate processes using ports
lsof -ti:3001,3002,3003 | xargs kill -15
# If any processes remain, force kill as a last resort:
lsof -ti:3001,3002,3003 | xargs kill -9
```

**5. Build Failures with Rspack**
```javascript
// Add to rspack.config.js for compatibility
resolve: {
  alias: {
    '@module-federation/runtime$': require.resolve('@module-federation/runtime')
  }
}
```
