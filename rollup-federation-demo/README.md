# Rollup Federation Demo

This example demos consumption of federated modules from a Rollup bundle. `rollup-spa` depends on a component exposed by `webpack-spa`.

---

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `webpack-spa` and `rollup-spa` on ports 8081 and 8082 respectively.

- REMOTE (webpack-spa): [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/)
- HOST (rollup-spa): [localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/)
