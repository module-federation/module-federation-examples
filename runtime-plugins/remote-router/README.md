Host Application

The host application is the main application in a microfrontend architecture. It is responsible for loading and integrating remote microfrontends into a single cohesive application. The host application uses Webpack 5's Module Federation feature to dynamically load remote microfrontends at runtime.
Remotes Monorepo

The remotes-monorepo is a monorepo that contains multiple remote microfrontends. Each microfrontend is a separate application that can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. The remotes-monorepo uses Nx, a powerful build system, to manage the different applications in the monorepo.
Runtime Plugin

The runtimePlugin.js file is a part of the host application. It is a custom plugin that provides several hooks to customize the behavior of the application at runtime.

Here's a brief overview of what each method does:

- name: This is the name of the plugin.

- errorLoadRemote({id, error, from, origin}): This method is called when there's an error loading a remote microfrontend. It logs the error and returns a module that displays an error message.

- init(args): This method is called when the plugin is initialized. It simply returns the arguments it was called with.

- beforeRequest(args): This method is called before a request is made to load a remote microfrontend. It modifies the entry property of the remotes to point to the correct URLs.

This plugin is a crucial part of the host application as it handles the loading of remote microfrontends and provides a way to handle errors that may occur during this process.
