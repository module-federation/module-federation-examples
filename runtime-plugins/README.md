# Runtime Plugin Examples

Uses the federation 1.5 apis in rspack or `@module-federation/enhanced` to implement example runtime plugins for control inversion.

- control-share
  - GUI that renders in-app, displays a form with all shared modules, allows you to alter the share resolver rules accordingly to the form. (gives you control over share module negotiations)
