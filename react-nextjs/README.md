This repo has some examples of module federation that may exist, and it's a WIP, so we will add examples along the way, for instance, react host with react remote and more.

* Disclaimer for NextJS apps you need the lates version of `@module-federation/nextjs-mf` that is a paid module, you can red more [here](https://app.privjs.com/buy/packageDetail?pkg=@module-federation/nextjs-mf)


#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Host
- It is a top-level app that depends on modules exposed from a remote app 
- Runs on port `8080`

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Remote
- Exposes components: for example `Nav` to another app called host.
- Runs on port `8081`

#### üîÑ BI-Directional
It is a middle-level app, which depends on modules exposed from remote app, for example can be : react ,react-dom or others. In the meantime, it also exposes components: for example `Nav` to another host apps 

### üõ†Ô∏è Set Up and running module federation types
- Clone the project
- Navigate to the type of module federation you are interested to run

  - Navigate to `nextjs-host-remote` folder
  - Run in the root folder: `yarn`
  - Run: `yarn start`
  - Navigate to: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
