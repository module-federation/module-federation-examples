# Module Federation using ESbuild

## Usage

1) npm install
2) npm run build
3) npm run start

Apps will be running on http://localhost:3000, http://localhost:3001

## Help Wanted

Commonjs support:

Right now we depend on importing commonjs libraries from esm.sh like:

```js
import React from "https://esm.sh/react";
import ReactDOM from "https://esm.sh/react-dom";
```

It would be nice if we can use:

```js
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
```
